    "# Back Propagation Neural Network with PyTorch Deep Learning Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will implement a previously implemented Back Propagarion Neural Network (BPNN) in one of the established deep learning frameworks. The framework of our choise is [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org). The other, and even more popular, framework is [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org), but it is more focused on production and manipulation with raw data, which will be our case, is more tedious. Of course, if you would like to use it or any other framework, you are welcome to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "At the university, we would use Linux with Python installed. In your own environment, please follow the [installation instruction](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for your platform. I personally prefer to use `pip` as package manager. For me, it is easier to install.\n",

    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to use this Jupyter Notebook file, you have install `jupyter` and then run `jupyter-notebook` from command line next to the `ipynb` file. If you want more mature environment, you can install `jupyterlab` and enjoy.\n",
